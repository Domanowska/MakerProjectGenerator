# MakerProjectGenerator
Generate some ideas if you're stuck wondering what to work on next.

### How it works?
Once you run the script it will ask how many ideas you want to generate;
```
$  python main.py 
How many ideas do you want to generate? 5 
Build a stamp out of paper clips.
Build a puzzle out of yarn.
Build a shelf out of pipe cleaners.
Build a phone case out of popsicle sticks.
Build a shirt out of mason jars.
```
Rerun the script as need until you get an idea that sparks joy!

### Customizing project ideas
You can add objects and materials in the `objects.py` and `materials.py` files under the `/src` folder.
You can remove any objects and materials you don't like too.
